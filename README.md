MetaOnPass: Cross-Reality Decentralized Identity
🚀 Project Overview
MetaOnPass is a decentralized identity management system that leverages blockchain and cross-reality technologies (XR) to provide users with secure and immersive identity solutions. This project aims to bridge the gap between physical and virtual worlds by enabling users to manage their digital identities across multiple platforms.

💡 Inspiration
As digital interactions grow, having a decentralized, user-controlled identity that can be used across multiple platforms (including virtual and augmented reality) is becoming essential. We built MetaOnPass to offer users a seamless, secure, and cross-platform identity solution, which can be accessed through the blockchain and interactively experienced in XR environments.

🔑 Key Features
Decentralized Identity Management: Based on Ethereum smart contracts, users own and manage their identities.
Cross-Reality Support: Supports immersive experiences in AR/VR environments.
Secure Authentication: Utilize blockchain technology and Metamask integration for secure authentication.
Web3 Integration: Interact with decentralized services through smart contracts.
