###### MetaOnPass: Cross-Reality Decentralized Identity
##### Project Overview
MetaOnPass is a decentralized identity management system that uses blockchain and cross-reality technologies (XR) to offer secure and immersive identity solutions for users. A decentralized identity management system that bridges the gap between two worlds: the physical and virtual; enabling users to manipulate their digital identities across multiple platforms.
Hear me out:
As digital engagement grows, the decentralized identity that could be controlled by users and used across multiple platforms including virtual and augmented reality rapidly loses the availability of being indispensable. We created MetaOnPass to give the customers an easy, safe, and cross-platform identity solution that can be accessed through blockchain and experienced interactively in XR environments.

##### Key Features

Decentralized Identity Management: It is based on Ethereum smart contracts where users own and manage their identities.
Cross Reality Support: Enhances the experience with augmented and virtual reality.
Secure Authentication: Utilizes blockchain-based technology, integrating Metamask to guarantee secure authentication.
Web3 Integration: Facilitates decentralized service interaction through smart contracts.

##### Built With
## Languages
JavaScript (React.js, Node.js, Web3.js, Three.js)
Solidity- For writing Ethereum Smart contracts
HTML5/CSS3- For UI and design
## Frameworks
React.js- Front-end application building for UI components
Node.js- Backend for API management
Express.js- Backend routing and API building
Three.js- 3D graphics and cross-reality environments
Blockchain Platforms:
Ethereum (For decentralized identity protocol building, through smart contracts)
IPFS InterPlanetary File System (For decentralized file storage)
Polygon (Optional, for scalability with Layer 2 solutions)
Cloud Services & Storage:
## AWS For cloud hosting
Infura For Ethereum blockchain access via IPFS
## Databases:
MongoDB For storing user-related metadata
Firebase For real-time authentication and data syncing
## Tools & Libraries:
Web3.js For Ethereum blockchain integration
MetaMask API Blockchain wallet integration
React Three Fiber For embedding 3D experiences in React
 Unity For XR experiences

##### What We Learned
In the process of developing MetaOnPass, we learned :
Development of Decentralized Applications on Ethereum and Web3
Integration of Cross-reality Environments with 3D frameworks like Three.js and Unity
Enabling Secure Identity Solutions with great scalability
Working with IPFS for decentralized storage and file handling
##### Challenges We Faced
Compatibility of Cross-reality: How to integrate XR technologies seamlessly in a decentralized identity system.
Blockchain Network Latency: Situations wherein slow times of transactions occur on mainnet Ethereum, with solutions like layer 2 â€“ Polygon
IPFS Storage: Complexity of decentralized file storage.
##### Sucesses We Are Proud of
 Built a decentralized cross-reality identity management platform
 XB and blockchain integrate
 Decentralized authentication application for Web3 MetaMask support
##### What is Next for MetaOnPass?
 Mobile Application: As a mobile app, make MetaOnPass accessible to the users
 Multi-Chain Support: See other blockchain platforms to be broad-minded with no stone unturned, for example Binance Smart Chain
 Add More XR Features to expand XR environments in avatars with VR conferencing
